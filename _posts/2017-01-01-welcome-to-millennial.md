### Jekyll Starter Kit

The Jekyll Starter Kit is a simple framework for starting your own Jekyll project using all of the best practices that I learned from building my other Jekyll themes.

Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/jekyll-starter-kit" target="_blank">the GitHub repository</a>, where youâ€™ll also find instructions on how to use install and use the theme.
