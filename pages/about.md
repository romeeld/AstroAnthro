title: About AstroAnthro
---

Welcome to AstroAnthro! We are an interdisciplinary group studying the field of astronomy, astronomers, cultural astronomy, and indigenous astronomy. For our research we use data collection techniques, theories, and analysis from anthropology, science & technology studies, indigenous studies, history, and folklore. 

The Astronomy & Society group is based at the <a href="http://uwc.ac.za">University of the Western Cape</a>. Jarita Holbrook leads the group. The EAGER group is based at the University of California, Los Angeles. Sharon Traweek leads the group with Jarita Holbrook. The South African Oral History Project is a joint University of the Western Cape and the University of South Africa project. Lerothodi Leeuw and Jarita Holbrook lead the project.  

Our group members are in South Africa, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Sharing data, doing analysis, and writing articles across platforms and time-zones led us to explore ways to make our collaboration easier and more productive. For several years we employed the Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (<a href="http://worldpece.org/about" >PECE </a>), but found that our team members used it rarely or not at all.
