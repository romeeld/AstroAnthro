<h2>Astronomy & Society</h2>

The Astronomy & Society group is based in the Physics & Astronomy Department at the University of the Western Cape. Jarita Holbrook is the project lead. Astronomy & Society centers on South Africa and includes the following: The film SKA â‰¥ Karoo Radio Telescope records the expectations of South Africans of the benefits of the Square Kilometre Array. 


<p>The master's thesis in <a href="https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/WGS/Pages/default.aspx">Women's and Gender Studies</a>(UWC) by Thembilihle Bongwana titled "Gendered Dynamics in South African Astrophysics: A Case Study of the South African Astronomical Observatory" focuses on the people working at SAAO. </p>

Holbrook was the videographer on the SKA <a href="https://www.skatelescope.org/shared-sky/">"Shared Sky"</a> art project, several videos were produced as well as a joint <a href="http://maajournal.com/Issues/2016/Vol16-4/Full11.pdf">article</a> with Jose De Prada Samper on |xam skylore. 

Master's student Rodwell Sibusiso Ndlovu's article analysing age as a variable in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeM9JyKKvO_EzP2LlTUd6NBWadPEBRan6HOrWdUe16k4KnEyg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Sky in Our Lives Survey</a> was presented at the <a href="http://www.brera.inaf.it/SEAC2015/index.html">SEAC 2015</a> conference in Rome and published in <a href="http://maajournal.com/Issues/2016/Vol16-4/Full69.pdf">Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry</a>.

<h2>Women and Minority Astronomers Strategic Engagement with Distributed, Multi-Disciplinary Collaborations and Large Scale Databases</h2>
The project is based in the <a href="http://www.genderstudies.ucla.edu">Gender Studies</a> Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. The project is jointly lead by Sharon Traweek and Jarita Holbrook. Using ethnographic interviews with scientists involved with data-driven astrophysics, we explored the strategies that the underrepresented undertake to craft their careers. The most recent article <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/reaching-for-the-stars-without-an-invitation">"Reaching for the Stars without an Invitation"</a> appeared in American Scientist. This project was funded by NSF grant <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0956589">0956589</a>
